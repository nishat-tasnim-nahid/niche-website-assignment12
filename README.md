#### Baby Toys Throughout the baby’s development, play is an important learning experience for them. It is equally important that the toy is suitable for the baby’s age. The time from the baby’s birth to when he or she turns one consists of significant changes. Baby toys stimulate the senses, particularly sight, sound, and touch which plays a big part in how the baby learns to adapt. Children go through various stages of development at different ages. Through the ages of 0-6 months, babies are discovering all of life’s sensations. They discover how to use their hands, feet, eyes and most of their senses.
